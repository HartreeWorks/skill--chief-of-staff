# Good morning, Mr President

**Date:** Tuesday 14 January 2026
**Week:** 2026-W03

## Today's schedule

| Time | Event | Calendar |

## Week plan status

**Theme:** Ship the dashboard redesign

**Key priorities:**
1. ✅ Complete dashboard wireframes — *Done Monday*
2. 🔄 Review and approve final designs — *In progress*
3. ⚠️ Write API documentation — *Not started, needs attention*
4. 📅 Prep for Acme Corp call — *Scheduled for today*

**Today in week plan:**
> Tuesday: Design review with Alice. Finalise component library decisions. Start API docs if time permits.

| API Documentation | Behind | Block 2 hours this week to outline structure |

## Overnight results

## Yesterday's activity

**Time breakdown:** 7h 15m tracked (6h 30m work, 45m personal)

**By project:**
- Dashboard Redesign: 3h 45m
- Q1 Planning: 1h 30m
- API Documentation: 45m
- Untagged: 30m

**People interacted with:** Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dana
**Organisations:** Acme Corp, Internal

- ✅ Priority 1 (Dashboard): 3h 45m invested
- ✅ Priority 4 (Acme prep): Started research
- ⚠️ Priority 3 (API docs): Only 45m — needs more focus

## Friction patterns

**Recurring issue detected (4 occurrences):**
> "Finding the right Figma file for design reviews"

*Suggestion:* Create a pinned bookmark system or naming convention for active design files.

## AI capability building

**Today's opportunity:**
Your 16:00 client call with Acme Corp could benefit from automated meeting prep. The `meeting-prep` skill could pull:
- Previous meeting notes from Google Docs
- Recent email threads
- Their latest product updates

**Quick wins in pipeline:**

| Idea | Value | Effort | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Meeting prep automation | High | Low | Pull context from multiple sources |
| Figma file organiser | Medium | Low | Address the friction pattern above |
| Weekly digest generator | Medium | Medium | Summarise week's progress automatically |

*Would you like me to scope out the meeting prep automation?*

## Suggested focus

Based on today's schedule and priorities:

1. **Morning:** Respond to Alice's Slack message about the colour palette before your 11:00 review
2. **After product review:** Block 1 hour for API documentation outline
3. **Before 16:00:** Use meeting prep to gather Acme Corp context

The API documentation is falling behind — consider protecting a 2-hour block tomorrow morning.

## What can I help with?

1. Run meeting prep for your Acme Corp call
2. Draft a response to Charlie's auth flow question
3. Create an API documentation outline based on your codebase
4. Schedule a focused documentation block on your calendar
5. Something else?

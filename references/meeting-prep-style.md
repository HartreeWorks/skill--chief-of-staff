# Peter's meeting prep style

When preparing meeting agendas and notes, follow this format.

## Structure

1. **Key questions for the call** — Numbered list of the main things to resolve
   - Background/lower-priority items in parentheses
   - Keep questions crisp and decision-oriented

2. **Agenda** — Simple time-boxed sections
   - Use time ranges like `[30-40 mins]`
   - Brief bullet points, not detailed scripts
   - Focus on activities and discussion topics

## Example

```markdown
**Key questions for the call:**

1. Is the `auto-publish` skill promising enough to justify further investment?

2. What does it take to give Alice what she needs to improve the skill further?

3. What "improve the skill" tasks should Alice delegate to Bob?

4. Next steps…?

5. *(Background) How to roll this out to other team members? Who should try next? Charlie?*

**Agenda:**

* [30-40 mins] Coworking
  * Alice runs the skill
  * We debug and refine

* [10-20 mins] Discuss key questions
```

## Key principles

- **Questions first** — Lead with what needs to be resolved, not activities
- **Concise** — No over-structuring or minute-by-minute scripts
- **Time-boxed but flexible** — Ranges not exact times
- **Decision-oriented** — Focus on outcomes, not process
